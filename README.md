- 👋 Retired after 25 years as profesional software author and developer in C++
- 👀 I’m interested in making C++ nicer to use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever lands in front of me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making life more rewarding for those who still have to code for a living.
- 📫 How to reach me. I haven't decided yet.
